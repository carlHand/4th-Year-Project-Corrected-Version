    <string name="BMIheading">Body Mass Index(BMI)</string>
    <string name="BMIdesc">The body mass index (BMI) is a physical measurement used to assess an individual\â€™s total amount of body fat. The BMI was invented by Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet in the 1800s, and consequently is sometimes known as the Quetelet index. The BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in (lbs) by your height (in) squared (m2) and multiplying by 703.</string>
    <string name="BMIheading2"><u>What does your BMI mean?</u></string>
    <string name="BMIdesc2">The BMI scores give an indirect measure of body fat. Depending on the BMI value calculated you may be underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese. The cut off values are as follows:</string>
    <string name="BMItableHeading"><u>Table 1: BMI cut-off values</u></string>
    <string name="classif">Classification</string>
    <!-- Table row 2 -->

    <string name="class6"> &#62;40.0</string>
    <string name="obese3">Obese Class 3</string>

    <string name="BMIheading3"><u>Why are BMIs useful?</u></string>
    <string name="BMIdesc3">The BMI is a simple, inexpensive screening tool used to identify possible weight problems for both adults and children. A BMI measurement is useful to assess who needs further testing to identify health risks such as heart disease. Individuals at risk will need further assessment. Assessments may include skin fold thickness test, diet, physical activity level, family history and other appropriate health screenings.</string>

    <!-- BMRDialog Layout -->
    <string name="BMRheading">Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR)</string>
    <string name="BMRdesc">Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy required to maintain the body\'s normal metabolic activity, such as respiration, maintenance of body temperature (thermogenesis), and digestion. Specifically, it is the amount of energy required at rest with no additional activity. The energy consumed is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, and skin.</string>
    <string name="var"><u>Variance</u></string>
    <string name="varDesc">The basal metabolic rate generally decreases with age or if there is a decline in lean body mass.  In order to maintain the resting metabolic rate as we age, requires regular strength training in order to prevent loss of skeletal muscle. Activities that tend to increase muscle mass (lean tissue) such as body building or strength training  (anaerobic activities), will also increase the basal or resting metabolic rate.   Aerobic activities such as running, skating,  or rope jumping may improve endurance but have little effect on the basal or resting metabolic rate (see post&#45;exercise expenditure below).  Other factors that may affect the BMR or RMR include stress, illness, hormone levels (e.g. thyroid), environmental (e.g. temperature or altitude) or any other factor that effects the normal functioning of one or more vital organs.
Lean tissue requires significantly more energy to maintain because of the increased level of metabolic activity. In contrast, fat tissue requires very little energy to maintain and has little influence on the resting or basal metabolic energy needs.
Greater lean body mass &#61; Greater BMR or RMR.
Because individuals can increase their total lean body mass through strength training (corresponding increase in skeletal muscle), it is possible to increase the overall basal energy requirements at rest.</string>
    <string name="BMRsubHeading"><u>Post-exercise energy expenditure</u></string>
    <string name="BMRdesc2">The amount of additional energy (above the resting or basal metabolic needs) expended after an activity depends on the intensity and duration of the exercise session. More intense sessions tend to increase resting energy needs for longer time periods. These increased energy requirements occur during the cool&#45;down phase and are short&#45;lived. Sustained increases in the resting or basal metabolic rate can only be obtained through regular strength training routines that increase lean body mass.</string>
    <string name="summ"><u>Summary</u></string>
    <string name="summDesc">Aerobic activity&#58; short lived increases in RMR/BMR (cool-down period)
Anaerobic activity (regular)&#58; increases in lean body weight (LBW) &#45;&#45;&#62; Sustained increases in RMR&#47;BMR.</string>

    <string name="util"><u>Utilization</u></string>
    <string name="utilDesc">The baseline BMR or RMR can be used along with stress/activity factors to estimate the daily caloric needs of an individual &#47; (Total Energy Expenditure (TEE)  (kcal&#47;day)).   See error rate below.</string>
    <string name="TEEh"><u>Total Energy Expenditure (TEE)</u></string>
    <string name="TeeD">The total energy expenditure (amount of calories needed per day) is composed of three primary factors: (1) Resting or basal metabolic rate   (2) Thermic effect of food  (3) Activities of daily living (ADL) &#45; physical activity.

    <string name="zone1Heading"><u>The Energy Efficient or Recovery Zone &#45; 60&#37; to 70&#37;</u></string>
    <string name="zone1Desc">Training within this zone develops basic endurance and aerobic capacity. All easy recovery running should be completed at a maximum of 70&#37;. Another advantage to running in this zone is that while you are happily fat burning you may lose weight and you will be allowing your muscles to re&#45;energise with glycogen, which has been expended during those faster paced workouts.</string>
    <string name="zone2Heading"><u>The Aerobic Zone - 70&#37; to 80&#37;</u></string>
    <string name="zone2Desc">Training in this zone will develop your cardiovascular system. The body\'s ability to transport oxygen to, and carbon dioxide away from, the working muscles can be developed and improved. As you become fitter and stronger from training in this zone it will be possible to run some of your long weekend runs at up to 75&#37;, so getting the benefits of some fat burning and improved aerobic capacity.</string>
    <string name="zone3Heading"><u>The Anaerobic Zone &#45; 80&#37; to 90&#37;</u></string>
    <string name="zone3Desc">Training in this zone will develop your lactic acid system. In this zone, your individual anaerobic threshold (AT) is found &#45; sometimes referred to the point of deflection (POD). During these heart rates, the amount of fat being utilised as the main source of energy is greatly reduced and glycogen stored in the muscle is predominantly used. One of the by&#45;products of burning this glycogen is lactic acid. There is a point at which the body can no longer remove the lactic acid from the working muscles quickly enough. This is your anaerobic threshold (AT). Through the correct training, it is possible to delay the AT by being able to increase your ability to deal with the lactic acid for a longer period of time or by pushing the AT higher.</string>
    <string name="zone4Heading"><u>The Red Line Zone 90&#37; to 100&#37;</u></string>
    <string name="zone4Desc">Training in this zone will only be possible for short periods. It effectively trains your fast twitch muscle fibres and helps to develop speed. This zone is reserved for interval running and only the very fit are able to train effectively within this zone.</string>

    <string name="mentalPic">Participation in physical activity and sport has been shown to be effective for reducing&#58; depression, anxiety, psychological distress, emotional disturbance. A review of research on this topic found that low-to-moderate physical exercise, even in a single session, can reduce anxiety.
Another year-long study concluded that increases in aerobic fitness have both short and long-term beneficial effects on psychological health.</string>
    <string name="recoveryPic">It is rest that makes you stronger, because it is the rest that allows the muscles that you have broken down to heal and recover. It is the rest that allows you to recover so you can be strong, and thereby handle the increased weight, and increased number of sets and reps needed to gain further.</string>
    <string name="plyoPic">Plyometrics are also called plyos, and they consist of powerful and fast movements. They involve relaxing and contracting muscles in fast sequences, making use of elasticity, innervations, and strength of tissues and muscles that are involved in running faster, jumping higher, and throwing farther. Thus plyometrics are especially useful for track and field athletes. Soccer, rugby, racket sports, martial arts, and basketball also make use of plyometrics.</string>
    <string name="vitDpic">There is strong correlation between vitamin D sufficiency and optimal muscle function. Increasing levels of vitamin D reduce inflammation, pain, and myopathy while increasing muscle protein synthesis, ATP concentration, strength, jump height, jump velocity, jump power, exercise capacity, and physical performance.</string>
    <string name="regPic">Physical activity that makes you puff and sweat is key to avoiding an early death, a large study of middle-aged and older adults has found.
The researchers followed 204,542 people for more than six years, and compared those who engaged in only moderate activity (such as gentle swimming, social tennis, or household chores) with those who included at least some vigorous activity (such as jogging, aerobics or competitive tennis).</string>
